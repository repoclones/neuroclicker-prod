    '<div class="title">08.02.2024  - Nwero Clicker: An Update Log Entry</div>' +
    '<div class="listing">&bull; Hello, I am Xodabeef; a part of the Team behind this Cookie Clicker Mod.</div>' +
    '<div class="listing">&bull; I am the main Artist, but i am here in the code now too. The reason is simple: we wanted to cut back on unnecessary files (Orteil left a LOT of shit in here). That made me look for references to the Dungeon Minigame in the code. It is not referenced anywhere, meaning i can (and likely have when you read this) delete all files related to the Dungeon Minigame, to both make this smaller and have a more clear estimate on how much is still to be done.</div>' +
    '<div class="listing">&bull; While looking for these references, i found out about the way these comments work. And because of how easy it is (and out of boredom), i decided to put our names in here.</div>' +
    '<div class="listing">&bull; I have also removed some of the older changelogs, since they are not necesary.</div>' +

    '</div><div class="subsection update small">' +
    '<div class="title">01/04/2019 - 2.019 (the "this year" update)</div>' +
    '<div class="listing">&bull; game has been renamed to "Cookie Clicker" to avoid confusion</div>' +
    '<div class="listing">&bull; can now click the big cookie to generate cookies for free</div>' +
    '<div class="listing">&bull; removed fall damage</div>' +
    '<div class="listing">&bull; fixed various typos : player\'s name is now correctly spelled as "[bakeryName]"</div>' +
    '<div class="listing">&bull; removed all references to computer-animated movie <i style="font-style:italic;">Hoodwinked!</i> (2005)</div>' +
    '<div class="listing">&bull; went back in time and invented cookies and computer mice, ensuring Cookie Clicker would one day come to exist</div>' +
    '<div class="listing">&bull; game now fully compliant with Geneva Conventions</div>' +
    '<div class="listing">&bull; dropped support for TI-84 version</div>' +
    '<div class="listing">&bull; released a low-res retro version of the game, playable here : <a href="https://orteil.dashnet.org/experiments/cookie/" target="_blank">orteil.dashnet.org/experiments/cookie</a></div>' +
    '<div class="listing">&bull; updated version number</div>' +

    '</div><div class="subsection update small">' +
    '<div class="title">05/03/2019 - cookies for days</div>' +
    '<div class="listing">&bull; added over 20 new cookies, all previously suggested by our supporters on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/dashnet" target="_blank">Patreon</a></div>' +
    '<div class="listing">&bull; added 2 heavenly upgrades</div>' +
    '<div class="listing">&bull; the Golden goose egg now counts as a golden cookie upgrade for Residual luck purposes</div>' +
    '<div class="listing">&bull; golden sugar lumps now either double your cookies, or give you 24 hours of your CpS, whichever is lowest (previously was doubling cookies with no cap)</div>' +
    '<div class="listing">&bull; the amount of heralds is now saved with your game, and is used to compute offline CpS the next time the game is loaded; previously, on page load, the offline calculation assumed heralds to be 0</div>' +
    '<div class="listing">&bull; added a system to counteract the game freezing up (and not baking cookies) after being inactive for a long while on slower computers; instead, this will now trigger sleep mode, during which you still produce cookies as if the game was closed; to enable this feature, use the "Sleep mode timeout" option in the settings</div>' +
    '<div class="listing">&bull; vaulting upgrades is now done with shift-click, as ctrl-click was posing issues for Mac browsers</div>' +
    '<div class="listing">&bull; made tooltips for building CpS boosts from synergies hopefully clearer</div>' +
    '<div class="listing">&bull; fixed an exploit with gambler\'s fever dream working across exports and ascensions</div>' +
    '<div class="listing">&bull; can now hide tooltips in the garden by keeping the shift key pressed to make it easier to see where you\'re planting</div>' +
    '<div class="listing">&bull; fixed a bug with golden cookies/reindeer not disappearing properly in some circumstances</div>' +
    '<div class="listing">&bull; the Dragon\'s Curve aura should now properly make sugar lumps twice as weird</div>' +
    '<div class="listing">&bull; the ctrl key should less often register incorrectly as pressed</div>' +
    '<div class="listing">&bull; added a new ad slot in the top-right, as while our playerbase is strong and supportive as ever, our ad revenue sometimes fluctuates badly; we may remove the ad again should our income stabilize</div>' +
    '<div class="listing">&bull; made a few adjustments to make the game somewhat playable in mobile browsers; it\'s not perfect and can get buggy, but it\'s functional! (you may need to zoom out or scroll around to view the game properly)</div>' +
    '<div class="listing">&bull; speaking of which, we also got some good progress on the mobile app version (built from scratch for mobile), so stay tuned!</div>' +

    '<div class="listing">&bull; season switches have reworked prices</div>' +
    '<div class="listing">&bull; season switches can now be cancelled by clicking them again</div>' +
    '<div class="listing">&bull; can no longer accidentally click wrinklers through other elements</div>' +
